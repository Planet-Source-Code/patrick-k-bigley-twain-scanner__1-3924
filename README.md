## TWAIN Scanner


</div>

### Description

Flatbed scanner, Hand Held, or any TWAIN compliant device can be accessed in Visual Basic with the EZTWAIN DLL (Included free as freeware). I like this much better than the KODAK OCX for scanning. This uses less resources and less coding. Don't flood me with a ton of questions on this project. Once you use it, you will know as much as I do. REMEMBER to copy the EZTW32.DLL into your Windows System Directory!!!!!
